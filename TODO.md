# TODO

 * Get `__profile.statsId` from Index.
 * Which analytics should be turned on? (`__profile.enabledAnalytics`)
 * What unit are Consumable bids in? (`__profile.bidUnitInCents`)
 * Handle regions other than US?
 * Switch to `CallbackTypes.ID` or `CallbackTypes.CALLBACK_NAME`, and
   `RequestTypes.ANY`, if these options are really supported by ADTECH.
